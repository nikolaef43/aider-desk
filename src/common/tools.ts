Use this tool for:
- Writing new code.
- Modifying or refactoring existing code.
- Explaining code segments.
- Debugging code.
- Implementing new features.
- This tools must be preferred (if not specified by user otherwise) over other tools creating or modifying files, as it is more efficient and effective.

Prerequisites
- All relevant existing project files for the task MUST be added to the Aider context using 'add_context_files' BEFORE calling this tool.

Input:
- A clear, complete, and standalone natural language prompt describing the coding task.

Restrictions:
- Prompts MUST be language-agnostic. Do NOT mention specific programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), libraries, or syntax elements.
- Treat Aider as a capable programmer; provide sufficient detail but avoid excessive handholding.

RETRIEVAL STRATEGY:
1. Identify what type of information you need (user preferences, code patterns, architectural decisions, or stable project reference)
2. Formulate a query with 3-7 descriptive words that includes key concepts and context
3. Use natural language - describe what you're looking for as if explaining to another developer

EFFECTIVE QUERY EXAMPLES:
- "LLM provider integration patterns"
- "Voice control implementation details"
- "Testing framework configuration"
- "Project architecture and component structure"
- "User interface theming system"
